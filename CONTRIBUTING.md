# Contributing

We greatly appreciate contributions to CKB. Besides submitting code, we welcome contributions in many other forms. The goal of this document is to explain how you can get involved.



Did you have problems implementing CKB or do you have a feature request? We would love to hear about it! Here are the most efficient ways to report an issue:

# Report Issue

- **Determine where to submit**

CKB projects are spread across multiple repositories. Please file your issue within the correct repository. If you're not sure which repository is the correct one, check the [list of related projects](https://www.notion.so/cryptape/Resources-10217c86ec47455d9220567bd75d180c).

- **Find existing issues**

Before reporting a new issue, please search the [open issues](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/projects/2) to see if someone has already submitted the issue or feature. If you find a similar issue, please comment on it and add your response. Use the following reactions instead of "+1" comments:

- üëç - vote
- üëé - veto

If you can't find an existing issue describing your bug or functionality, please create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Well-Written Bug Reports and Feature Requests

Submit one issue per bug or feature request. Don't list multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue. Don't add your question as a comment to an existing question unless it's for the same input. Many problems look similar but have different causes. The more information you provide, the more likely you are to successfully reproduce the problem and find a solution.

Please include the following in your submission:

1. **Do not open up a GitHub issue to report security vulnerabilities**. Instead,
refer to the [security policy](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb/blob/develop/SECURITY.md)
2. When creating a new issue, be sure to include **a title and clear description**. It is appreciated that if you can also attach as much relevant information as possible, including:
- Version
- Environment
- Reproducing steps (1, 2, 3)
- What you expected vs what you actually saw
- Samples
3. If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

### Checklist

Remember to do the following:

- [x]  Search the issue repository to make sure your report is a new issue
- [x]  Simplify the code around the problem to better show the problem

### Send PR

- See [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for commit guidelines.
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### Propose new features

See [Nervos Network RFCs Process](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs).
